name: grilling
description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Each question should be formatted like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it — don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report — ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.

## Self-Improvement Loop

At the end of every run of this skill, before ending the turn, review the run:

- Did any step fail, need a workaround, or behave differently than this file describes?
- Did the user correct, reject, or meaningfully rework something this skill produced?
- Did you discover something a future run needs (a changed ID, a tool quirk, a better sequence)?

**The bar:** propose an update ONLY if it would change what a future run actually does, or prevent a repeat of a real mistake. No cosmetic tweaks, no hypothetical improvements, no flagging for the sake of it. Most runs should end with nothing to propose.

If something clears the bar, end the run with:

> **Proposed update to this skill:** [one line — what changes and why]

Wait for approval. On approval, edit this SKILL.md in place (update the relevant section — don't append a changelog). If this skill lives in a git repo, commit and push the change in the same turn.
